  Everything You Need To Know About Tangent
</h1>
  <h2>
    What is Tangent?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The tangent of an angle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the side adjacent the angle.  
    The tangent of an angle is the line x=y on a graph where the vertex of the angle is at the origin and one ray is on the x-axis.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Values of Tangent
  </h2>
<p>
  The most basic angles are 30, 45, and 60 degree angles.
      The tangent of 30, 45, and 60 degree angles are 1/sqrt3, 1 and sqrt3 respectively. 
</p>
  <h2>The Relationship Between Tangent, Sine, and Cosine</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike sine and cosine, we didn't learn a way to find the tangent of an angle(at least I don't think we did). To find the tangent of an angle you must use the special relationship between tangent, sine, and cosine.
  Tangent is equal to Sine/Cosine. That means to find the tangent of an angle you just need to divide the sine of the angle by the cosine of the angle.
  </p>
  <h2>Pythagorean Identity</h2>
  <p>
    This isn't related to tangent but it is another relationship between sine and cosine. The sine of an angle multiplied by the sine of the same angle added to the cosine of the same angle multiplied by the cosine of the same angle is 1. 
  </p>
  <h2>Cotangent</h2>
  <p>
    Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent. For example, the cotangent of a 60 degree angle is
