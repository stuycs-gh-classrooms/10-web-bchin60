<h1>
  Everything You Need To Know About Cosine
</h1>
  <h2>
    What is Cosine?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The cosine of an angle is equal to the length of the side adjacent to the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle.  
    The cosine of an angle is equal to the x-value of the angle on a graph where the vertex of the angle is at the origin and one ray is on the x-axis.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Values of Cosine
  </h2>
<p>
  The most basic angles are 30, 45, and 60 degree angles.
      The sine of 30, 45, and 60 degree angles are sqrt3/2, sqrt2/2 and 1/2 respectively. To find the cosine of other angles you must use the basic angles.
</p>
  <h2>
    How to Find the Cosine of non 30, 45, or 60 degree angles</h2>
  <p>
    Finding the cosine of other angles requires a method called SigMa. SigMa is the combination of two words: sign and magnitude.
    First, you must figure out which quadrant the terminal side is in. The terminal side is the side of the angle that is not on the x-axis.
    The quadrant will help you determine the sign of the angle. If the angle is in quadrant 1 or 4 then the sign is positive. If the angle is in quadrant 2 or 3 then the sign is negative.
    Then, you must find the magnitude or, reference angle. The reference angle is the angle formed by the terminal side and the x-axis.
    Depending on whether the reference angle is 30, 45, or 60 you combine steps one and two.
  </p>
    <h2>
      Example Problem
    </h2>
  <p>
    Find the cosine of a 240 degree angle.
    A 240 degree angle would be in quadrant 3 which means the sign would be negative.
    The reference angle of a 240 degree angle would be 60 degrees.
    By combining the two steps you will get the answer to the problem which is -1/2
  </p>
      <h2>
        Secant
      </h2>
  <p>
    Secant is the reciprocal of cosine. For example, if the cosine of a 60 degree angle is 1/2 then the secant of the angle is 2/1 or 2.
</p>
  <h2>Finding the cosine of angles that don't have reference angles of 30, 45, or 60</h2>
  <p>I'm sure there's a way to do it but we didn't learn it so just use a calculator</p>
