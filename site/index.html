<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Trig(Even Though You Technically Don't Need it)</h1>
<h2>What is Trig?</h2>
<p>
  Trig is short for trigonometry. Trigonometry comes from the Greek words trigon(triangle) and metron(measure). Putting these words together becomes the measure of triangles or, trigonometry.

<h2>What is Trig Used For?</h2>
<p>
  Trig's main purpose is to find the measures of sides and angles of triangles. Trig's secondary purpose is torturing innocent tenth graders all around the world.

<h2>How can Trig be used in real life?</h2>
<p>
  Trig can be used in very niche real-life situations that will probably never happen. One example is if your leg is broken and you need to get food at the top of a tree. If for some reason you happen to have a grappling hook, know the distance between yourself and the tree, and know the height of the tree, you can use trig to figure out the exact distance the grappling hook needs to be thrown. Without a working knowledge of physics, you probably won't be able to throw the grappling hook an accurate distance but at least you'll know how far the grappling hook should go.
