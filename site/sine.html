<h1>
  Everything You Need To Know About Sine
</h1>
  <h2>
    What is Sine?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The sine of an angle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle.  
    The sine of an angle is equal to the y-value of the angle on a graph where the vertex of the angle is at the origin and one ray is on the x-axis.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Values of Sine
  </h2>
<p>
  The most basic angles are 30, 45, and 60 degree angles.
      The sine of 30, 45, and 60 degree angles are 1/2, sqrt2/2 and sqrt3/2 respectively. To find the sine of other angles you must use the basic angles.
</p>
  <h2>
    How to Find the Sine of non 30, 45, or 60 degree angles</h2>
  <p>
    Finding the sine of other angles requires a method called SigMa. SigMa is the combination of two words: sign and magnitude.
    First, you must figure out which quadrant the terminal side is in. The terminal side is the side of the angle that is not on the x-axis.
    The quadrant will help you determine the sine of the angle. If the angle is in quadrant 1 or 2 then the sign is positive. If the angle is in quadrant 3 or 4 then the sign is negative.
    Then, you must find the magnitude or, reference angle. The reference angle is the angle formed by the terminal side and the x-axis.
    Depending on whether the reference angle is 30, 45, or 60 you combine steps one and two.
  </p>
    <h2>
      Example Problem
    </h2>
  <p>
    Find the Sine of a 240 degree angle.
    A 240 degree angle would be in quadrant 3 which means the sign would be negative.
    The reference angle of a 240 degree angle would be 60 degrees.
    By combining the two steps you will get the answer to the problem which is -sqrt3/2
  </p>
      <h2>
        Cosecant
      </h2>
  <p>
    Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine. For example, if the sine of a 30 degree angle is 1/2 then the cosecant of the angle is 2/1 or 2.
</p>
  <h2>Finding the sine of angles that don't have reference angles of 30, 45, or 60</h2>
  <p>I'm sure there's a way to do it but we didn't learn it so just use a calculator</p>
