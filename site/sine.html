  Everything You Need To Know About Sine
</h1>
<p>
   The sine of an angle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle.
      The sine of an angle is equal to the y-value of the angle on a graph where the vertex of the angle is at the origin and one ray is on the x-axis.
      The sine of 30, 45, and 60 degree angles are 1/2, √2/2 and √3/2 respectively.
      To find the sine of other angles, you must first find the reference angle of the angle. A reference angle is the acute angle formed by the terminal side and the x-axis.
      After finding the reference angle you must figure out whether this angle has a positive sine or negative sine. If it is positive the y-value of the angle will be positive.
      The sine of the angle is equal to the sine of the reference angle but if the sine of the angle is negative then the sine of the angle is equal to the negative sine of the reference angle.
      The sine of an angle is also equal to the reciprocal of the cosecant of the angle and vice versa.
